document_title: Net Neutrality Scoreboard
title: Here's where every Congressperson stands on net neutrality
intro_html: |
  It can be hard to keep track of who supports net neutrality and who doesn’t … especially with cable companies and their lobbyists pushing for fake net neutrality legislation. So we’re here to help.
  
  Below you’ll find a link to a list of your state’s senators and representatives. The lawmakers in green supported a 2018 Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to overturn the FCC’s net neutrality repeal, while the lawmakers in red failed to support it. New members of Congress sworn in this year are highlighted in grey. We’ll be updating the scoreboard to reflect who has agreed to co-sponsored the Save the Internet Act in the coming days.
