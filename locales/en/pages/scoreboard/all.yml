document_title: Net Neutrality Scoreboard
title: Here's where every Congressperson stands on net neutrality
intro_html: |
  It can be hard to keep track of who supports net neutrality and who doesn’t …
  especially with cable companies and their lobbyists pushing for fake net
  neutrality legislation. So we’ve created the Congressional Scoreboard to help.

  Members of Congress highlighted in blue are on Team Internet because they’ve 
  cosponsored the Save the Internet Act. Lawmakers highlighted in red are on Team 
  Cable because they’re not cosponsors and they refused to support strong protections 
  in 2018. New members of Congress and members who supported strong net neutrality in 
  2018 but aren’t yet cosponsors of the Save the Internet Act are highlighted in grey 
  as neutral.
