    Hundreds of millions of people all across America support net neutrality, and I'm one of them.

    Right now the cable industry is working with members of Congress to pass loophole-riddled net neutrality legislation that will allow Internet service providers (ISPs) to impose widespread throttling and extra fees.

    No legislator in favor of an open Internet should support the fake net neutrality bills announced by Republican members of the Communications & Technology Subcommittee in February 2019. I'm calling on you to reject new proposals written by cable industry lobbyists and, instead, ask you to co-sponsor the “Save the Internet Act” to reinstate the strong protections for net neutrality and broadband access afforded by the FCC's now-repealed 2015 Open Internet Order.

    We expect nothing less than the net neutrality protections the FCC undemocratically repealed in 2017. Please work with your colleagues to pass legislation that genuinely protects the digital rights of your constituents.

    Thank you.

    title: The Whole Internet Is Watching
    body_html: |
        On Tuesday, March 26th, lawmakers are expected to vote on amendments to the Save The Internet Act to
        restore net neutrality.  Unfortunately, telecom lobbyists are pushing amendments to give
        ISPs new powers to block, throttle and charge Internet users new fees.  If we get the bill
        out of committee without any bad changes, we can win the next big vote on the House floor.
        But if it gets gutted next week, we’re back to square one.

        Starting Monday, March 25th, websites, Internet users, and online communities will work
        together to plaster the committee hearing livestream across the Internet on websites, social
        media accounts, blogs… basically everywhere! When the committee meeting begins, we'll stream 
        it live so the whole Internet can watch.

        **Here’s what you can do to make sure Congress knows the whole Internet is watching:**

          <a href="/media"
          target=_blank">awesome graphics</a> to get the word out.</li>
          <li><strong>Tell everyone to text WATCH to 687-88.</strong> They can set a reminder to watch the
          hearing and pressure their members of Congress to pass a clean bill from their smartphone.</li>

      We're making Congress listen
    body_html: |
      Voters from across the political spectrum agree: they don't want their
      cable company to control what they see and do online. The FCC's reckless
      repeal of net neutrality has sparked an unprecedented backlash, as
      millions of Americans have contacted their lawmakers in protest.  The
      numbers below represent actions taken through BattleForTheNet.com and its
      partners. Many more have taken action on other sites or contacted their
      lawmakers directly.

      To help convince the House, <a href="#bftn-action-form">contact congress

      Our scoreboard keeps track of who <b>really</b> supports net neutrality.  Members of

      Lawmakers highlighted in red are on Team Cable because they’re not cosponsors and
      they refused to support strong protections in 2018. New members of Congress and
      members who supported strong net neutrality in 2018 but aren’t yet cosponsors of
      the Save the Internet Act are highlighted in grey as neutral.

  net-neutrality:
    title: What is net neutrality? Why does it matter?
    body_html: |
      Net neutrality is the principle that everyone should have access to
      websites and apps, preventing Internet providers like Comcast & Verizon
      from creating “<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/02/verizons-mobile-video-wont-count-against-data-caps-but-netflix-will/"
      target="_blank">fast lanes</a>,” <a

      target="_blank">blocking access</a> to their competitor's products. This
      principle has guided the world wide web from the beginning, and has been
      protected by federal policy under Republican AND Democrat leadership since
      the <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-05-151A1.pdf"
      target="_blank">early 2000s</a>.

      Unfortunately, Internet providers ignored this policy and even actively
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications_Inc._v._FCC_(2014)"
      target="_blank">sued the federal government</a> to destroy net neutrality
      protections … and they won. Their anti-consumer practices finally convinced
      the FCC to issue the Open Internet Order as a last resort in 2015. But
      under new leadership, the FCC has removed these regulations, threatening
      to end the web as we know it.

      Team Cable wants to end net neutrality so they can control and tax the

      If they get their way, we will all pay more money for worse Internet
      access. Independent voices <a href="https://www.donttreadonthe.net/"

      struggle to compete in the online marketplace.
