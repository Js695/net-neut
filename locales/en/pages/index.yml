    Hundreds of millions of people all across America support net neutrality, and I'm one of them.

    Right now the cable industry is working with members of Congress to pass loophole-riddled net neutrality legislation that will allow Internet service providers (ISPs) to impose widespread throttling and extra fees.

    No legislator in favor of an open Internet should support the fake net neutrality bills announced by Republican members of the Communications & Technology Subcommittee in February 2019. I'm calling on you to reject new proposals written by cable industry lobbyists and, instead, ask you to co-sponsor the “Save the Internet Act” to reinstate the strong protections for net neutrality and broadband access afforded by the FCC's now-repealed 2015 Open Internet Order.

    We expect nothing less than the net neutrality protections the FCC undemocratically repealed in 2017. Please work with your colleagues to pass legislation that genuinely protects the digital rights of your constituents.

    Thank you.

    title: The Whole Internet Is Watching
    body_html: |
        On Tuesday, April 9th, the US House of Representatives voted to save the Internet
        by passing
        <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1644"
        target=_blank">HR-1644</a>, a bill that would restore Title II net neutrality
        protections that keep cable companies from from throttling traffic, censoring
        content, and imposing unfair fees.  Now we need to win in the Senate.

        To win the Senate, we'll need 60 votes in order to avoid a filibuster. That's
        because the Speaker of the House has declared net neutrality
        <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-internet/senate-republican-leader-calls-net-neutrality-bill-dead-on-arrival-idUSKCN1RL2HE"
        target=_blank">"dead on arrival"</a>. That's okay; we like a challenge. After
        all, a nearly identical measure to restore net neutrality passed a Senate vote
         <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/16/17357592/net-neutrality-senate-vote-cra-reinstate-fcc-rules"
        target=_blank">"last year"</a>!

        So we know that there are Senators on both sides of the aisle who are willing to
        listen to the American people. But we need help to make sure lawmakers in
        Congress get the message. **Here’s what you can do:**

          <li><strong>Tell everyone to text WATCH to 687-88.</strong> They can set a reminder to watch the

    body_html: |
      In 2015, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted the

         target="_blank">
        Open Internet Order</a>
      to protect Internet users from ISPs throttling traffic, censoring content,
      and imposing unfair fees. But just a few years later, a new chairman of the FCC
      <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/14/technology/net-neutrality-repeal-vote.html"
         target="_blank">
        killed net neutrality</a>
      by repealing the Open Internet order. Since then, cable companies like

        Comcast, AT&T, and Sprint</a>

        Americans want net neutrality</a>,
      and we’ve demanded that our lawmakers pass strong legislation to prevent
      unelected bureaucrats from changing the rules whenever they want to. And
      our lawmakers have listened.

        The Save the Internet Act of 2019</a>
      is a simple, three-page bill that would restore the Open Internet Order
      by rolling back the FCC’s disastrous decision to destroy net neutrality.
      If this bill passes the House and the Senate, it will enshrine net
      neutrality into law. Plain and simple.

      We're making Congress listen
    body_html: |
      Voters from across the political spectrum agree: they don't want their
      cable company to control what they see and do online. The FCC's reckless
      repeal of net neutrality has sparked an unprecedented backlash, as
      millions of Americans have contacted their lawmakers in protest.  The
      numbers below represent actions taken through BattleForTheNet.com and its
      partners. Many more have taken action on other sites or contacted their
      lawmakers directly.

    title: What is net neutrality? Why does it matter?
    body_html: |
      Net neutrality is the principle that everyone should have access to
      websites and apps, preventing Internet providers like Comcast & Verizon
      from creating “<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/02/verizons-mobile-video-wont-count-against-data-caps-but-netflix-will/"
      target="_blank">fast lanes</a>,” <a

      target="_blank">blocking access</a> to their competitor's products. This
      principle has guided the world wide web from the beginning, and has been
      protected by federal policy under Republican AND Democrat leadership since
      the <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-05-151A1.pdf"
      target="_blank">early 2000s</a>.

      Unfortunately, Internet providers ignored this policy and even actively
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications_Inc._v._FCC_(2014)"
      target="_blank">sued the federal government</a> to destroy net neutrality
      protections … and they won. Their anti-consumer practices finally convinced
      the FCC to issue the Open Internet Order as a last resort in 2015. But
      under new leadership, the FCC has removed these regulations, threatening
      to end the web as we know it.
