    Hundreds of millions of people all across America support net neutrality, and I'm one of them.

    Right now the cable industry is working with members of Congress to pass loophole-riddled net neutrality legislation that will allow Internet service providers (ISPs) to impose widespread throttling and extra fees.

    No legislator in favor of an open Internet should support the fake net neutrality bills announced by Republican members of the Communications & Technology Subcommittee in February 2019. I'm calling on you to reject new proposals written by cable industry lobbyists and, instead, ask you to co-sponsor the “Save the Internet Act” to reinstate the strong protections for net neutrality and broadband access afforded by the FCC's now-repealed 2015 Open Internet Order.

    We expect nothing less than the net neutrality protections the FCC undemocratically repealed in 2017. Please work with your colleagues to pass legislation that genuinely protects the digital rights of your constituents.

    Thank you.

    title: The Whole Internet Is Watching
    body_html: |
        Next week lawmakers are expected to vote on amendments to the Save The Internet Act to 
        restore net neutrality.  Unfortunately, telecom lobbyists are pushing amendments to give 
        ISPs new powers to block, throttle and charge Internet users new fees.  If we get the bill 
        out of committee without any bad changes, we can win the next big vote on the House floor. 
        But if it gets gutted next week, we’re back to square one.

        Starting Monday, March 25th, websites, Internet users, and online communities will work 
        together to plaster the committee hearing livestream across the Internet on websites, social 
        media accounts, blogs… basically everywhere! The hearing is expected early next week but the 
        exact date and time are TBD.  When it starts we’ll stream it live so the whole Internet can 
        watch.

        **Here’s what you can do to make sure Congress knows the whole Internet is watching:**

    title: Here’s how we get Congress to save net neutrality
    body_html: |
      Our elected officials in Congress can save net neutrality by rejecting fake legislation and passing laws that
      prevent Internet providers from throttling traffic, censoring online content, and imposing unfair fees on
      businesses and users alike.

      This will require a bipartisan effort from lawmakers, which may seem like science fiction in
      these deeply divided political times.  But net neutrality is not a partisan issue.  In fact,
      an overwhelming majority of Americans
      <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/overwhelming-bipartisan-majority-opposes-repealing-net-neutrality-survey-finds-300569665.html"
      target="_blank">support net neutrality</a>,
      including Republicans, Democrats and Independents alike.  And we’ve successfully pushed
      lawmakers to
      <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/05/16/net-neutrality-is-getting-a-big-vote-in-the-senate-today-heres-what-to-expect/"
      target="_blank">cross the aisle</a> in support of net neutrality efforts before.

      <h3>
        <br>
        Here’s how we’ll do it this time:
      </h3>

      <ul>
        <li class="calls">
          <h4>
            <img src="/images/gradient-calls.png" alt="">
            <span>Flood them with calls and emails</span>
          </h4>
          <p>
            When millions of people call and email their representatives, Congress listens.
            That’s why we developed a widget that website owners can place on their site,
            giving their site’s users the opportunity to contact Congress. And we’ve created
            art assets that will allow individuals to spread the word on powerful
            social media platforms.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="constituents">
          <h4>
            <img src="/images/gradient-constituents.png" alt="">
            <span>In-district constituent pressure</span>
          </h4>
          <p>
            It’s important for lawmakers to see the people who support net neutrality.  We’ll
            help schedule in-person events, protests, meetings, and canvassing to mobilize
            constituencies (
            <a href="https://www.vetsforthe.net/"target="_blank">like veterans</a>
            ) that lawmakers listen to.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="business">
          <h4>
            <img src="/images/gradient-business.png" alt="">
            <span>Mobilizing small businesses</span>
          </h4>
          <p>
            In Washington, money talks. So lawmakers
            listen to the small business owners in their districts because those
            business owners are vital to the local economy. We need to reach out to
            small business owners to ask them to sign our
            <a href="https://www.businessesfornetneutrality.com/">petition</a> in
            support of net neutrality, then we hand-deliver this petition to our
            politicians.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      We're making Congress listen
    body_html: |
      Voters from across the political spectrum agree: they don't want their
      cable company to control what they see and do online. The FCC's reckless
      repeal of net neutrality has sparked an unprecedented backlash, as
      millions of Americans have contacted their lawmakers in protest.  The
      numbers below represent actions taken through BattleForTheNet.com and its
      partners. Many more have taken action on other sites or contacted their
      lawmakers directly.

      To help convince the House, <a href="#bftn-action-form">contact congress

      Our scoreboard keeps track of who <b>really</b> supports net neutrality.  Members of 
      Congress highlighted in blue are on Team Internet because they’ve cosponsored the

      Lawmakers highlighted in red are on Team Cable because they’re not cosponsors and 
      they refused to support strong protections in 2018. New members of Congress and 
      members who supported strong net neutrality in 2018 but aren’t yet cosponsors of 
      the Save the Internet Act are highlighted in grey as neutral.

    title: What is net neutrality? Why does it matter?
    body_html: |
      Net neutrality is the principle that everyone should have access to
      websites and apps, preventing Internet providers like Comcast & Verizon
      from creating “<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/02/verizons-mobile-video-wont-count-against-data-caps-but-netflix-will/"
      target="_blank">fast lanes</a>,” <a

      target="_blank">blocking access</a> to their competitor's products. This
      principle has guided the world wide web from the beginning, and has been
      protected by federal policy under Republican AND Democrat leadership since
      the <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-05-151A1.pdf"
      target="_blank">early 2000s</a>.

      Unfortunately, Internet providers ignored this policy and even actively
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications_Inc._v._FCC_(2014)"
      target="_blank">sued the federal government</a> to destroy net neutrality
      protections … and they won. Their anti-consumer practices finally convinced
      the FCC to issue the Open Internet Order as a last resort in 2015. But
      under new leadership, the FCC has removed these regulations, threatening
      to end the web as we know it.

    body_html: |
      Team Cable wants to end net neutrality so they can control and tax the

      href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-fcc-says-net-neutrality-cripples-investment-thats-not-true/"
      target="_blank">lies about the effects of net neutrality</a> on the free

      If they get their way, we will all pay more money for worse Internet
      access. Independent voices <a href="https://www.donttreadonthe.net/"
      target="_blank">will be stifled</a>. And innovative start-ups will
      struggle to compete in the online marketplace.
