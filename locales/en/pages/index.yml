    Hundreds of millions of people all across America support net neutrality, and I'm one of them.

    Right now the cable industry is working with members of Congress to pass loophole-riddled net neutrality legislation that will allow Internet service providers (ISPs) to impose widespread throttling and extra fees.

    No legislator in favor of an open Internet should support the fake net neutrality bills announced by Republican members of the Communications & Technology Subcommittee in February 2019. I'm calling on you to reject new proposals written by cable industry lobbyists and, instead, work to restore the strong protections for net neutrality and broadband access afforded by the FCC's now-repealed 2015 Open Internet Order.

    We expect nothing less than the net neutrality protections the FCC undemocratically repealed in 2017. Please work with your colleagues to pass legislation that genuinely protects the digital rights of your constituents.

    Thank you.

        target="_blank">91% of Americans</a> believe consumers should be able to freely and quickly access their preferred content
        on the Internet. But big cable companies want to force us to use their products to watch their content. And if we don’t like
        it, too bad; with limited competition, they can charge us unfair fees and decide who does &mdash; and doesn’t &mdash; get
        Internet service.

        That’s why they’ve introduced
        <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gop-lawmakers-introduce-another-fake-net-neutrality-bil-1832431221"
        target="_blank">fake net neutrality bills</a>. These bills talk about
        <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1006/"
        target="_blank">"Internet openness,"</a> but they actually seek to reclassify broadband providers to prevent the FCC from
        enforcing any rules at all.  This will allow Verizon to

        So take whatever corner of the Internet that you control — whether it’s a major platform or a personal
        Instagram account — and use it to pressure Congress. Here’s how:

    title: Here’s how we get Congress to save net neutrality
    body_html: |
      Our elected officials in Congress can save net neutrality by rejecting fake legislation and passing laws that
      prevent Internet providers from throttling traffic, censoring online content, and imposing unfair fees on
      businesses and users alike.

      This will require a bipartisan effort from lawmakers, which may seem like science fiction in
      these deeply divided political times.  But net neutrality is not a partisan issue.  In fact,
      an overwhelming majority of Americans
      <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/overwhelming-bipartisan-majority-opposes-repealing-net-neutrality-survey-finds-300569665.html"
      target="_blank">support net neutrality</a>,
      including Republicans, Democrats and Independents alike.  And we’ve successfully pushed
      lawmakers to
      <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/05/16/net-neutrality-is-getting-a-big-vote-in-the-senate-today-heres-what-to-expect/"
      target="_blank">cross the aisle</a> in support of net neutrality efforts before.

      <h3>
        <br>
        Here’s how we’ll do it this time:
      </h3>

      <ul>
        <li class="calls">
          <h4>
            <img src="/images/gradient-calls.png" alt="">
            <span>Flood them with calls and emails</span>
          </h4>
          <p>
            When millions of people call and email their representatives, Congress listens.
            That’s why we developed a widget that website owners can place on their site,
            giving their site’s users the opportunity to contact Congress. And we’ve created
            art assets that will allow individuals to spread the word on powerful
            social media platforms.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="constituents">
          <h4>
            <img src="/images/gradient-constituents.png" alt="">
            <span>In-district constituent pressure</span>
          </h4>
          <p>
            It’s important for lawmakers to see the people who support net neutrality.  We’ll
            help schedule in-person events, protests, meetings, and canvassing to mobilize
            constituencies (
            <a href="https://www.vetsforthe.net/"target="_blank">like veterans</a>
            ) that lawmakers listen to.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="business">
          <h4>
            <img src="/images/gradient-business.png" alt="">
            <span>Mobilizing small businesses</span>
          </h4>
          <p>
            In Washington, money talks. So lawmakers
            listen to the small business owners in their districts because those
            business owners are vital to the local economy. We need to reach out to
            small business owners to ask them to sign our
            <a href="https://www.businessesfornetneutrality.com/">petition</a> in
            support of net neutrality, then we hand-deliver this petition to our
            politicians.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      We're making Congress listen
    body_html: |
      Voters from across the political spectrum agree: they don't want their
      cable company to control what they see and do online. The FCC's reckless
      repeal of net neutrality has sparked an unprecedented backlash, as
      millions of Americans have contacted their lawmakers in protest.  The
      numbers below represent actions taken through BattleForTheNet.com and its
      partners. Many more have taken action on other sites or contacted their
      lawmakers directly.

      To help convince the House, <a href="#bftn-action-form">contact congress

      It can be hard to keep track of who supports net neutrality and who doesn’t …
      especially with cable companies and their lobbyists pushing for fake net
      neutrality legislation. So we’re here to help.

      Below you'll find a link to a list of your state's senators and representatives.
      The lawmakers in green signed a discharge petition to overturn the FCC’s net
      neutrality repeal, so tell them how much you appreciate their support on this
      important issue. The lawmakers in red failed to support the discharge petition,
      so contact their office to let them know that actions speak louder than words.

    title: What is net neutrality? Why does it matter?
    body_html: |
      Net neutrality is the principle that everyone should have access to
      websites and apps, preventing Internet providers like Comcast & Verizon
      from creating “<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/02/verizons-mobile-video-wont-count-against-data-caps-but-netflix-will/"
      target="_blank">fast lanes</a>,” <a

      target="_blank">blocking access</a> to their competitor's products. This
      principle has guided the world wide web from the beginning, and has been
      protected by federal policy under Republican AND Democrat leadership since
      the <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-05-151A1.pdf"
      target="_blank">early 2000s</a>.

      Unfortunately, Internet providers ignored this policy and even actively
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications_Inc._v._FCC_(2014)"
      target="_blank">sued the federal government</a> to destroy net neutrality
      protections … and they won. Their anti-consumer practices finally convinced
      the FCC to issue the Open Internet Order as a last resort in 2015. But
      under new leadership, the FCC has removed these regulations, threatening
      to end the web as we know it.
